Purpose: Describe the API requirement to connect to the HVAC simulator. 

+API description:

I assume Python is being used. 

"get" functions: 
	- Descritpion: Get new state ("get" functions). I will call this function and expect the states being returned. You can return different states by different funcitons or return an array or return in a tuple.
	- Required output: 
		current energy consumption (power, unit Watt) - data type (float, double, ndarray (1x1), or PyTorch tensor (1x1))
		current room temperature - output data type (float, double, ndarray (1x1), or PyTorch tensor (1x1))
		current chiller setpoint - output data type (float, double, ndarray (1x1), or PyTorch tensor (1x1))
		current boiler setpoint - output data type (float, double, ndarray (1x1), or PyTorch tensor (1x1))
		current damper setpoint - output data type (float, double, ndarray (1x1), or PyTorch tensor (1x1))
		current outdoor temperature - output data type (float, double, ndarray (1x1), or PyTorch tensor (1x1))
		target room temperature - output data type (float, double, ndarray (1x1), or PyTorch tensor (1x1))
	- Comment: the name of the funciton can be customized by you
	- Example function on your side: 
		def get_room_temperature():
			room_temperature = .... # your code
			return room_temperature
	- On my side:
		room_temperature = get_room_temperature()

"set" functions: 
	- Description: Set the new setpoints for the chiller, boiler, and damper ("set" functions).
	- Required input:
		current chiller setpoint - input data type (double)
		current boiler setpoint - input data type (double)
		current damper setpoint - input data type (double)
		current outdoor temperature - input data type (double)
	- Example function on your side: 
		def set_chiller_setpoint(setpoint):
			.... # your code to set the chiller setpoint at "setpoint".
	- On my side:
		set_chiller_setpoint(setpoint)

+Type of connection:
	Option 1: I install a simulator. 
	Option 2: Set remote access from my end to your end. Possibly SSH or if you have a server. 

+general comments:
	Let's try to see if these information are enough to construct an RL agent.
